# Synthetic-Data-Generation
##Introduction
This project focuses on generating synthetic data from the training dataset provided in the "Data" sheet. The goal is to ensure that the synthetic dataset accurately reflects key statistical properties of the original data, including mean, variance, distribution patterns, and inter-variable relationships.
In addition, a detailed methodology note is prepared, outlining:
The approach used to generate synthetic data
The rationale behind choosing this method over alternative approaches
Comparative analysis of synthetic data, actual data, and the combined (actual + synthetic) dataset
This work aims to preserve the integrity of the original dataset while enabling safe data sharing and extended data availability for analysis and modeling.
